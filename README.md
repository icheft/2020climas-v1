CLIMAS Website for CLIMAS using Jekyll and Bootstrap 4.

This is a fork from [jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme). The original demo can be seen [here](https://jeromelachaud.com/freelancer-theme). 

You can visit my version of the site [here](https://icheft.github.io/climas/). Feel free do make any changes and make pull requests to make this website better. 

## TL;DR
The master branch is served as a theme that can be easily modified and used by anyone.
